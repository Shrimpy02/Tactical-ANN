# Tactical-ANN
Tactical-ANN is a C++ artificial neural network designed as a universal neural interface connecting to a virtual blackbox. Using reinforcement learning as a Q-Network it can learn from input data to produce accurate and learned output through experience and testing over many simulated epochs.
